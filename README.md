**Open Source Code for Level Set Topology Optimization**

OpenLSTO is an open-source software for level set based structural topology optimization, written in C++, developed and Maintained by researchers at UC San Diego and Cardiff University.

The topology optimization method deals with the problem of determining the optimal distribution inside a design domain in order to obtain the best structural performance. Level Set Method was originally developed as a mathematical tool for tracking the motion of interfaces. Its natural handling of topological changes coupled with a clear and smooth interface representation led to its use for structural topology optimization.

This first light version implements the M2DO labâ€™s level set topology optimization method to solve the problem of minimizing compliance (maximizing stiffness) under a volume constraint in a 2D design domain. It has been designed with ease of installation and use in mind. This means that, wherever possible, a conscious effort was made to develop in-house code components rather than relying on third-party packages or libraries. In simple cases (serial version with no external libraries), the code can be compiled and executed with just a C++ compiler.

Extended capabilities using externally provided software are to be included in the next, more advanced version.

## Installation
-  Download

To clone the repository to the local machine,(git client) 
```git clone https://github.com/M2DOLab/OpenLSTO.git```

The Zip file is also avaiable with the following static link: 
[Download link](http://m2do.ucsd.edu/static/zip/OpenLSTO-v0.1.zip)

- CLI environment

In general, all OpenLSTO execution occurs via command line arguments within a terminal. For Unix/Linux or Mac OS X users, the native terminal applications are needed. 

- Execution

Compile & Build: 
> make 

Execution
> ./a.out

Clean existing compilation files:
> make clean

clean existing object files:
> make M2DO_FEA_clean 

- External dependency

Users of OpenLSTO need a data visualization tool to post-process solution files. The software currently supports .vtk output format natively read by [*ParaView*](https://www.paraview.org/).
